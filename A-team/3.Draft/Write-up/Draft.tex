\begin{abstract}
The abstract should summarise succinctly and clearly the motivation for your research, as well as a description of your analysis and findings. 
The abstract should be written as a single paragraph and ideally should not exceed 200 words. 
Both title and full abstract should fit on a single title page. 
You should also include in  your abstract a list of keywords, as shown below. 
The abstract should be drafted after the paper has been written. 
You may, if you wish, include an acknowledgements page as a separate sheet at the end --- this will be included in the word count. 
A plagiarism declaration in the prescribed UCT format should accompany your final paper as a separate sheet.

\noindent
Keywords: mean-variance, weighted expected shortfall, portfolio diversification.
